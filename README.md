# JS Form Validation
    The Odin Project Js Form Validation Project.

## Details
    The project uses the JS Constraint Validation API to validate the text and data provided in the HTML form elements. It uses live inline validation to inform uses of any constraint violations, this means that the user is notified whether his input is correct or wrong as he type it. Example, when filing out the password field, notifications are displayed to show whether the length is too short, too long or empty.
